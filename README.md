Here are some confiration files that I use on my linux laptop. You can clone it to your machine and then link the files into where they should live, execute the following from this directory after ensuring that the target files have been removed.

* init.vim -> `ln -s $PWD/init.vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim`
* .tmux.conf -> `ln -s $PWD.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf`
